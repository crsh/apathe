**apathe** is an R package that facilitates writing computationally reproducible student theses that conform to the American Psychological Association (APA) manuscript guidelines (6th Edition).
The package provides an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) template that can be used with (or without) [RStudio](https://posit.co/) to create PDF documents (using the [apa6](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/apa6) LaTeX class).
**apathe** is built on top of the package [**papaja**](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) but is tailored to the specific requirements of student theses and omits some features for simplicity.

If you believe you have found a bug or would like to request a new feature, [open an issue](https://github.com/crsh/apathe/issues) on Github and provide a [minimal complete verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

## Installation

To use **apathe** you need either a recent version of [RStudio](https://posit.co/) or [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
You additionally need a [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) distribution; we recommend you use [TinyTex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/), which can be installed from within R:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("tinytex", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("tinytex")

tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Using other TeX distributions is possible.
Please refer to the [**papaja** manual](https://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/introduction.html#getting-started) for detailed installation instructions.

**apathe** is not yet available on CRAN but you can install it from this GitHub repository:

```{r install-apathe-github, eval = FALSE}
# Install remotes package if necessary
if(!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("remotes")

# Install the stable development version from GitHub
remotes::install_github("crsh/apathe")
```

## Usage

Once **apathe** is installed, you can select the APA-style thesis template when creating a new R Markdown file through the RStudio menus.

To add citations, specify your bibliography-file in the YAML front matter of the document (`bibliography: my.bib`) and start citing (for details, see pandoc manual on the [citeproc extension](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-citations)). **apathe** supports DOI-based citations via the [`doi2cite`](https://github.com/korintje/pandoc-doi2cite/blob/main/doi2cite.lua) filter, see [**rmdfiltr** vignette](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmdfiltr/vignettes/doi2cite.html). Any of the follow DOI tags can be used in the text:

- `@https://doi.org/`
- `@doi.org/`
- `@DOI:`
- `@doi:`

For example, `@doi:10.1080/01621459.2025.2516210`. When the document is rendered, `doi2cite` queries CrossRef for the bibliographic information, writes it to a local BibTeX-file and replaces the citation key by the proper BibTeX key.

This requires that the designated file `__from_DOI.bib` (it currently has to be this file name!) is added to the `bibliography` field of the YAML front matter

## Citation

Please cite **apathe** if you use it.

    `r attr(unclass(citation("apathe"))[[1]], "textVersion")`

For convenience, you can [use `cite_r()`](https://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/writing.html#citing-r-and-its-packages) or copy the reference information returned by `citation('apathe')` to your BibTeX file:

~~~bibtex

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
print(citation("apathe"), style = "Bibtex")
```

~~~
